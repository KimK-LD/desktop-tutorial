# Welcome to the Accessibility Accommodation Training file!

Please note is cleaned copy of the original file I created for City of Toronto. Branding and proprietary information has been changed. 

1) Analysis Summary: 
Recruiters required training to ensure the conversations with Hired Election Officials that requested accommodation were calm, controlled, and informed conversations complimented with detailed note taking and was required by AODA. This will ensure the Election Teams will be able to proactively action specific requests and provide support during their shifts in a sensitive respectful manner. 

Context: 
    1) Identified there was a Data and Process Gap with applicants request for Accommodations. 
    2) Connected with App Devs and Sr Management to confirm there was no planned outreach.
    3) Confirmed with HR the out reach was required as per AODA. 
   
2) Design: 
    Strategy: Self Led followed by Team Q&A

    Duration: <30 Mins
    Assessment/Feedback: Per Section

        1) Create Storyboard
        2) Create outreach script and acquire HR approval

Required: 
    1) Context to AODA and reasoning for outreach.
